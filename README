Bit Counting

Program to count the number of 1's (set bits) in the binary representaion of a given integer number. It also enumerates the position set bits relative to the position of the minimum set bit (MSB). The position of the MSB is defined as 1.

Constraints
1<N<10^9

Sample Input
161

Sample Output
3
1
3
8

Explanation

The binary represenation of integer 161 is 1010001.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
Binary Representation   |   1   | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |   1   |
MSB and LSB             |  MSB  | - | - | - | - | - | - |  LSB  |
Positions w.r.t. MSB    |   1   | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 |   8   |
-----------------------------------------------------------------

We can observe that there are three bits at position 1, 3, and 8 respective. Thus the answer will be:
3
1
3
8
(The first line of output is total number of set bits followed by position of set bits in increasing order)
